        Question : <br> <br>Explain thee difference between Undefined and not defined variables in JS using HTML page.<br>
    </p> <br>
    <p style="font-size: larger ;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In JavaScript, they both are related to memory space and there is a very simple difference between them. If the variable name which is being accessed doesn’t exist in memory space then it would be <mark style="background-color:burlywood;font-weight: bold;">Not Defined</mark>, and if exists in memory space but hasn’t been assigned any value till now, then it would be <mark style="background-color:burlywood;font-weight: bold;"> Undefined </mark> .</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div id="dis">
        <ol>
            <li><b>Not Defined:-</b></li>
            <p style="font-size: larger ;">In JavaScript, it is one of the reference errors that JavaScript will throw when someone accesses the variable which is not inside the memory heap.</p>
            <br>
            <li><b>Undefined:-</b></li>
            <ul>
               <li> <p> It is a JavaScript keyword that has a special meaning. Everything which gets a space in memory will contain undefined until we assign a value to that memory space.</p> </li>
              <li> <p>If you are assigning a function call to a variable, and that function doesn’t return anything, the variable will become undefined.</p></li>
            <li><p>You can explicitly assign undefined to any variable but it is not good practice to use language keywords in the way it is not expected.</p></li>
